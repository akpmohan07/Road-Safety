# Road-Safety
The system to detect the upcoming IRC signs, pedestrian/traffic density areas and accordingly warn the driver about the speed limit for the vehicle. The vehicle that had been driven above the given maximum speed limit that the respective road limits, are alerted to the nearby station using their coordinates and their registration number which plays a major role during some legal evidence. Feeling sleepy while driving could also cause a hazardous traffic accident. So, besides drivers drowsiness can also be detected and tend to slow down the vehicle.
